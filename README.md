### COVID-19

Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus.

The virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or exhales. These droplets are too heavy to hang in the air, and quickly fall on floors or surfaces.

You can be infected by breathing in the virus if you are within close proximity of someone who has COVID-19, or by touching a contaminated surface and then your eyes, nose or mouth.

**Most common symptoms:**
fever, dry cough & tiredness

**Less common symptoms:**
aches and pains, sore throat, diarrhoea, conjunctivitis, headache, loss of taste or smell, a rash on skin or discolouration of fingers or toes

- Machine Learning Algorithm and libraries are applied.
